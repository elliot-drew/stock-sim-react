# stock-sim-react

This is a stock price "game" written in React.

A Monte Carlo approach is used to generate prices for a fake stock, and visualised as a candlestick chart with simple moving averages. The prices are generated using the historical distribution, with an extra term to pull the prices back to the historical mean to prevent long term trends developing too often.

Set the simulation going by pressing the "play" button, pause it using the "pause" button and generate a new stock history with the reset button.

You start with 1000 in cash, and can buy and sell stocks. It can be fun to try and make a profit. Makes you realise why you dont day trade.

There is also a working calculator, if you wanna... calculate.

I am planning to add more things to the game, like random events, comission fees every N periods, perhaps options and margin trading.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
